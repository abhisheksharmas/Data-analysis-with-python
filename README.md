# 911 Calls Analysis Project
# Overview:
This project revolves around the analysis and visualization of emergency 911 call data, aiming to derive insights and patterns from emergency incidents. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about emergency calls, including reasons, timestamps, and locations, providing valuable insights into the nature and distribution of emergencies.

# Features:
Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of emergency call types, frequencies, and geographical patterns. \
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to extract meaningful information for analysis and visualization. \
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover trends, peak call hours, common reasons for calls, and geographical hotspots for emergencies. \
Temporal Analysis: Analyzing time-based patterns such as daily, weekly, or monthly trends in emergency calls. \
Geospatial Visualization: Plotting call locations on maps to visualize hotspots and areas with higher emergency incidences. 
# Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python \
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn\
Data Analysis and Visualization Techniques: Pandas DataFrames, Matplotlib plots, Seaborn visualizations, Geographic Mapping
